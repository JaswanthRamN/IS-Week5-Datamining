## Project Overview  

This project focuses on **Spam Classification using Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifiers**. The dataset used in this analysis is **"spam_dataset.csv"**, which contains word frequency features and a spam label.

### Key Steps in the Analysis:
- **Loaded the dataset** and explored its structure (head, description, and statistical summary).
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Selected word frequency features as predictors (`word1, word2, word3, word4`).
  - Defined the target variable (`spam`).
- **Model Training & Evaluation**:
  - Implemented **Gaussian Naïve Bayes** for spam detection.
  - Implemented **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to compare classification performance.
  - Split the dataset into **training (80%) and testing (20%)**.
  - Measured **accuracy and classification performance** for both models.
- **Results Comparison**:
  - Printed **accuracy scores** and **classification reports** for both classifiers.
  - Evaluated **which model performs better for spam detection**.

This project provides insights into **text classification techniques** using **machine learning algorithms**, comparing the effectiveness of **Naïve Bayes and KNN** for spam detection.
